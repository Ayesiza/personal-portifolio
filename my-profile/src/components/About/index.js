                I have been a Human resource information system officer where I enjoyed three years of experience. During that time I helped  LeewayUganda limited in procuring qualified employees and able to retain them and also helped staff enjoy user experience in accessing their records in a faster manner. 

                    Here are the few key skills I bring to the table:
                    My years at Leeway Uganda limited gave me excellent insight into the ins and outs of software and technology. This is actually what inspired me to make the slight move into Technology. I'm excited to zero in learning software working on a particular project so that I can become an expert in the tech world.
                    Before my tech journey, I started my own start-up and this gave me the ability to build business relationships with clients. I  have experience in both in-person and remote networking and relationships building and am an expert in maintaining positive experiences even in the most difficult of negotiations. Now that I wanted my relationship to grow stronger. 
                    This is when I was even more inspired to join software development. so that I can learn to build my business website for my customers to enjoy the user experience

                    Coming up with this change I had to build up my stamina for dealing with rapid changes and disappointments daily while managing my many moving parts. yes, I'm excited because since then I have improved my skills specialties in Javascript, nodejs, reactjs, and for now I can comfortably develop a full-stack web app.
                    I bring with me a high level of motivation and determination to figure out any challenge that is thrown at me which is useful in the tech world.
                    I'm looking forward to inspiring more women out there to believe in themselves and join me in this exciting move and their children
